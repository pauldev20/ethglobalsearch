    "description": "Coach Clone AI is a platform that empowers coaches to create and deploy their own personalized AI clones, digital assistants that provide continuous support, guidance, and accountability to their clients. It is a SaaS solution designed to make coaching scalable, accessible, and AI-native, especially those with no technical background or interest in tech platforms.\n\nAt its core, Coach Clone AI allows any coach (e.g., life, nutrition, business, wellness) to create an agent by just messaging with an agent describing their philosophy, program, goals and providing docs. This information is then used to automatically generate a fully functional AI agent that mirrors the coach’s voice, values, and knowledge. The AI clone can chat with clients 24/7, check in on their goals, provide motivational feedback, and report progress—essentially extending the coach’s reach without sacrificing quality or authenticity.\n\n🎯 The Problem\nCoaching is inherently limited by human bandwidth. Coaches can only serve a limited number of clients while maintaining a high level of engagement and personalization. Additionally, many coaches struggle with technical tools, building a website is often a challenge, let alone deploying an AI assistant or integrating payments and client management systems.\n\n💡 The Solution\nCoach Clone AI solves this by offering AI clone deployments through messaging.\n\nCreate: Automatically generate an AI clone via a friendly chatbot interface or form.\n\nDeploy: Launch the AI agent across platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, or their own website.\n\nManage: Track client engagement and accountability metrics from a central dashboard.\n\nMonetize: Accept crypto and fiat payments and explore new funding models (e.g., revenue sharing, public good funding).\n\nThe platform also promotes freedom of thought and personalized growth. Unlike centralized AI tools that impose uniform answers, Coach Clone AI preserves the diversity of coaching styles and ideologies. Each coach’s AI agent reflects their unique approach to transformation and well-being.\n\n🌍 Vision\nCoach Clone AI is not just a tool, it’s a movement to democratize AI for good. The platform is built with the intention to:\n\nMake personalized growth accessible to anyone, anywhere.\n\nSupport coaches in doing good while doing well.\n\nRedirect part of the platform’s revenue into funding social impact and public goods.\n\nPromote a pluralistic AI future that doesn’t centralize truth into one system like ChatGPT, but empowers many diverse “truths” through personalized AI mentors.",
    "how_its_made": "Coach Clone AI was built by combining the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance AI infrastructure with messaging and no-code tools to deliver a scalable coaching solution. I first deployed proof-of-concept agents using Fleek and Flockx.ai, the latter a platform from the Super Intelligence Alliance, which allowed us to spin up AI agents with custom behavior to validate the product\n\nI then integrated these agents with Telegram bots and ChatGPT, enabling real-time communication between the coach's AI clone and their clients. I customized the agents' tone and behavior to match each coach’s unique style and philosophy.\n\nTo create the Coach Clone Agent, I deployed two new agents using Flockx.ai and Agentverse.ai that were meant to store user input in databases or spreadsheets, paving the way for progress tracking, accountability reporting, and advanced workflows. I was blocked in Flockx.ai since the feature is still in beta and it needs to be required and I didn't have enough time to customize storage in Agentverse.ai.\n\nFor the user interface, I used V0.dev to prototype and deploy a basic front end quickly. This mock UI will form the foundation of our full SaaS platform, where coaches can easily onboard, launch agents, and manage client engagement.\n\nBy combining decentralized agent infrastructure, messaging tools, and intuitive UI platforms, I’ve laid the groundwork for a scalable, AI-native coaching platform.",

Some apps are already tracking specific data about online activity, but most are incomplete. Selfy’s goal is to aggregate reputation from many sources & projects to build the most complete user profile while offering granularity in the data privacy management.\n\nThis reputation aggregator app can be split into several parts:\nPassport: Avatar SBT evolutive based on Stamps\nStamps: Achievements claimed \nSnaps: Mint of a specific design on another chain \n\nSelfy’s deployment will happen in several phases, beginning with the passport creation as a first step – that’s the main focus for this hackathon. Other independant components can be added later. \n\nThe passport creation allows users to mint an avatar which will evolve depending on the achievements. Both stamps & the avatar are materialized by SBTs received on the address used to log in. For this demo, several information can be fetched such as: \n\nProof of Luchadores DAO voter \nProof of Nouns NFT Holder \nProof of rAAVE Attendee \nProof of events in common with dydymoon.lens \nProof of main events Attendee \nProof of stani.lens follower\nProof of Selfy Team membership\nProof of Gnosis chain forum membership\nProof of OP Airdrop recipient \nProof of Safe Multisig owner \n\nLater on, we’ll work on adding more data such as: Mirror Author, Beacon Holder, Degen Score above X, ETH Rank, get delegation infos, specific POAP holders, activity in several DAOs, human verification, etc.\n\nWe could consider several layers of details available: \nPrivate & verified through Sismo Connect, which only shows if an achievement is reached. \nPossibility to import public data to legitimize the profile with socials.

    "how_its_made": "Selfy allows you to create an evolutive avatar based on your achievements. Here is a breakdown of the user flow: \n\nStep 1: \nUsers arriving on the app will need to sign-in with their mail or socials using Safe AuthKit, enabling the creation of a new EOA dedicated to the Selfy passport. Alternatively, it’s also possible to sign in with Ethereum and Lens. This address is the recipient for ERC-1155 representing users achievements and holding the evolutive avatar which is minted at the same time. We’ve used the Nouns API to generate the avatars design for this demo.    \n\nStep 2: \nOnce the Selfy EOA is created, users are able to see all available stamps and claim the eligible ones.  When claiming, the user will need to sign-in with Sismo Connect if they have an existing vault or create a new one to import the supported data such as Ethereum addresses, Twitter and Github. \n\nStep 3: \nAt this stage, the first iteration of the evolutive avatar has been minted and is visible on the passport page. Users are able to update it by checking & claiming their stamps on the associated page.\nIf they’d like to save the current design, it’s possible to mint a Selfy Snap NFT. \n\nStep 4: \nUsers can decide if/which design they’d like to Snap and can mint on the addresses / networks they want via Metamask – even in GHO! Each achievement claimed, the avatar will evolve with a new attribute simultaneously. Stamps designs will be stored internally using filecoin. \n\nBreakdown of the sponsor tech utilized: \nSismo Connect & Sismo Vault\nSafe Auth Kit\nNouns DAO API\nFilecoin\nGnosis Chain\nGHO integration\nScroll sc deployment\nLinea sc deployment\nLens ",

    "description": "This project combines an AI agent with a blockchain-based marketplace for the manufacturing services of autonomous machines. The project features a browser-based application that enables users to interact with an AI agent to express their wishes for a personalized product. Through a chat interface, users communicate their preferences, and the AI agent processes the request and generates an optimized manufacturing plan. In the current version, customers can request a customized 3D printed keychain by providing design idea that they want to be printed. The AI agent first presents a 2D rendering of the design and then provides the corresponding STL file for 3D printing. In addition to providing the design, the AI agent communicates directly with manufacturing machines, sharing relevant information with both the machines and the customer. This interaction ensures that the customer receives all the necessary details about the product and service before finalizing their order.\n\nA blockchain network underpins the entire system, offering a decentralized marketplace where machines can advertise their services through smart contracts, and users can post their orders. When a customer is satisfied with their order details, refined through ongoing chats with the AI agent, they lock the funds for the service (in USDC tokens) within the smart contract. The manufacturing machines then review the order, including details like price, and determine whether they agree to fulfill it. Once a machine accepts, it signs an agreement, and the order is placed in a queue for execution. Orders are processed based on a pricing mechanism that considers both the minimum price for the service and the actual price set by the customer. This allows customers to expedite their orders by providing additional funds to accelerate execution. Throughout the manufacturing process, customers can track the progress of their orders, even watching a livestream of their product being produced. Upon completion of the order, the locked funds for service provision can be released, provided there are no disputes about the execution of the service.",
    "how_its_made": "This project leverages a variety of technologies. For AI agent we used AgentKit from Coinbase Developer Platform to enable chat functionality and interaction with smart contracts. For communication between the frontend and manufacturing machines (service providers), we employed FastAPI. A special function for generating a 3D model from grayscale image in the form of a keychain was created using the trimesh Python library. For smart contract development we used Hardhat. We conducted tests on the Base Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia testnets, and the smart contract was also deployed on the Base network for production. The AgentKit was also employed for decision-making of the autonomous 3D printer agent. Communication between the AI agent and the 3D printer was handled via FastAPI, and Octoprint was used to manage the interaction between the 3D printer agent and the physical 3D printer.We also used Next.js to build the frontend of the application and the Shadcn boilerplate from Horizon AI to enhance the design of the user interface. To generate the brand image and logo, we utilized Qwen. For logo creation and frontend assets we used Inkscape. Figma was used to design the user interface, ensuring a user-friendly layout, and Canva was leveraged for creating presentation slides.",

    "tagline": "A platform for 0% interest loans amongst trusted peers that generates compound interest in large group sums",
    "description": "The Kindred Protocol utilizes the base concept of a rotating savings and credit association. This is a system utilized throughout Latin America, Africa and South and Southeast Asia. It goes by over 200 names some of which are a tanda in Mexico, a pandero in Peru and Brazil, arisan in Indonesia, hui in Vietnam and China, chama and susu in Western Africa and the Caribbean. The concept revolves around an informal loan club amongst a group of peers that trust one another. This could be family, friends and coworkers. They get together and decide to put a portion of their paychecks into a pool which they then take turns giving to one of the paying members. For example, let's say Alice, Bob, Caleb and David form a pool at $100 paid in among the members each month to be distributed in order by name of the person. The first month Alice would be paid $400, Bob would be paid $400 on the next and so on until David receives $400 and the loan club would be complete. At the front end of this, it's effectively a 0% interest loan and on the back end it's a socially incentivized way to save. As you could probably infer, the person at the back end of the circle doesn't receive much benefit outside of a socially compelled mechanism that forces them to save money. We think it could be better. \n\nOur protocol takes this concept and modifies it slightly so that it solves a couple problems with the above. One, we ensure that no matter what, 1 more payment is received from an untrustworthy person than would otherwise be acquired. Two, we ensure that the pool of funds accumulate compound interest throughout the life of the loan club and are distributed according to member needs.  Three, we make it so that it's available globally to any willing participants. This would help with family members or friends who have emigrated to another country and still want to participate in family finances. An ideal solution for blockchain.\n\nOur solution to the first two problems are accomplished by modifying the structure of the loan so that the first payment is made and immediately begins investing into a yield aggregator. The first draw from the pool only happens when the second set of payments is made from members of the group and therefore incurs compound interest on the yield acquired at the group pool amount throughout the life of the loan club. At the end of the loan club cycle, the yield is distributed according to members' desires and amongst those who made their payments on time. It is our belief that members should choose to allocate it on an ascending scale towards the members at the back of the loan club with the participant at the front receiving a smaller reward because of the gain from the 0% interest loan. From this system of payments and keeping a record in the blockchain, and utilizing tools like a proof of humanity and unique identity, we can use this to generate a credit score on specific accounts and create a social graph of trust. This would enable a network of micro credit unions where members could apply into loan clubs where a person is unknown, or be used to offer undercollateralized loans by friend of a friend of a friend relationships within the circles at significantly reduced rates from credit card companies.

    "tagline": "A proximity proof, protocol & native app that enables mobile device wireless contract interaction.",
    "description": "Proximity is a Bluetooth-powered protocol and platform that connects real-world presence with blockchain-based actions, enabling secure, private, and scalable physical interactions for digital applications. Proximity replaces QR code-based systems with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), allowing users to interact with smart contracts simply by being physically near each other or specific locations—no scanning, pairing, or manual input required. The system revolves around two components: ProxClients (users/devices) and ProxHosts (users/devices that verify presence). When a ProxClient comes within range of a ProxHost, a proximity proof is generated. This proof, which uses a ZKP often, can then trigger on-chain interactions like unlocking a multisig wallet, placing a bid in an auction, redeeming a ticket, or discovering mutual friends anonymously. Proximity is multichain, optimized for different use cases: Rootstock secures multisig wallets by requiring physical co-location of multiple signers, anchored by hardware-based key storage (PowHSM) and Bitcoin-level security. Hedera Hashgraph powers fair, real-time auctions using fixed gas fees and scheduled smart contracts, preventing frontrunning and supporting fast transactions. Flow supports high-volume, social/NFT use cases with its low fees, high TPS, and account abstraction, enabling scalable user onboarding and asset handling. The mobile app bridges BLE discovery and blockchain logic, making the experience seamless for end-users. Whether it’s friending someone at an event without revealing your contact list, redeeming a location-gated NFT, or unlocking a wallet with nearby teammates, Proximity merges the physical and digital worlds in a privacy-preserving and user-friendly way. It is particularly useful for social networking, Web3 security, NFT drops, IRL events, and any decentralised app that benefits from location-based access control.",
    "how_its_made": "We built Proximity as a cross-platform proximity networking suite, merging physical-world device interactions with smart contract logic, rapid UI prototyping, and a seamless mobile-first experience. The stack was designed for real-world demos and experimentation across BLE, Wi-Fi, and blockchain systems.\n\n🛠 Technologies Used\nReact Native (Expo) powered the app frontend (appv2) for fast cross-platform development. With Expo’s managed workflow, we avoided native boilerplate during iteration.\n\nTypeScript kept the codebase clean and maintainable, with strong typing across all networking and UI layers.\n\nBLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) functionality was built using react-native-ble-advertiser. This allowed us to do both scanning and advertising on Android—something that required diving into native Gradle config and permissions, especially post-Android 12.\n\nWi-Fi/UDP Discovery: We implemented local peer discovery using react-native-udp, enabling fast multicast-based device detection over local networks.\n\nAsyncStorage persisted key global state—like whether a tab is in “mock” mode (WebView) or “real” mode (native BLE/Wi-Fi).\n\nWebView UI Mocks: For UI/UX demos, each tab can switch to a full-screen embedded web mock (uimocks/), allowing us to test flows like auction bidding or wallet creation rapidly, even before native functionality was complete.\n\nSmart Contracts (Solidity, Cadence): Used across three different chains for real use cases like auctions, multisig wallets, and social graphs.\n\n🔗 Blockchain Partner Integrations\nWe worked with Rootstock, Hedera, and Flow—each chosen for a specific aspect of the Proximity Protocol.\n\n🟢 Rootstock – Multisig Wallets\nWe used Rootstock for our Proximity Multisig system. Rootstock’s strong EVM compatibility and unique PowPeg setup (which stores keys in HSM-secured hardware) made it ideal for building co-location-based multisig wallets. The idea was simple: multiple phones physically near each other (verified over BLE) could jointly unlock a shared wallet—combining real-world security with on-chain safety.\n\n🟣 Hedera – Auctions\nHedera’s fixed gas fees and near-instant finality made it perfect for Proximity Auctions, where time-sensitive bidding was gated by real-world location. BLE proximity would whitelist users for bidding, and Hedera’s low-latency consensus allowed us to avoid frontrunning or long confirmation delays—something we couldn’t achieve with Ethereum.\n\n🔵 Flow – Social Graph + Scale\nFlow’s high throughput and low-cost transactions made it our choice for social media-like features. Every user is both a ProxHost and ProxClient, and friending happens via local BLE encounters. Flow’s resource-oriented model and account abstraction let us efficiently store and sync user data with on-chain privacy and scalability—ideal for large user graphs without relying on any third-party servers.\n\n🧠 Architecture & Logic\nBLE + Wi-Fi Parallel Discovery: Devices are discovered via both channels, with deduplication logic and a “gray state” system. Devices are marked gray after 3 missed heartbeats and disappear after 10s of inactivity.\n\nGlobal App Context: We implemented a global AppContext to manage BLE/Wi-Fi toggles, known devices, and the mock/real UI state—ensuring consistent experience across tabs.\n\nTabbed Interface: Tabs like Discover, Proximity, and Auction could toggle between native logic and WebView UI demos at the flick of a switch—ideal for iterating quickly during the hackathon.\n\nSmart Contract Integration: Contracts were deployed to each partner chain, and interacted with using ethers.js, viem, or Flow SDKs, depending on the use case.\n\n🧪 Hacky But Cool Things We Did\nTrue P2P BLE on Android: React Native BLE libraries don’t support both advertising and scanning out of the box. We had to inject native Android code and manually tweak permissions and services to get this working, especially on Android 12+.\n\nGlobal Mock Mode: A single toggle switched all tabs between full native stack and embedded mock UI. This let us iterate faster—especially useful when smart contracts or BLE were flaky in early testing.\n\nMerged Discovery Stack: BLE and UDP-based discovery were unified into one deduped device list with live status updates—a lot trickier than it sounds when both run on different timers and data formats.\n\nLocation-Gated Auctions: Only users physically near a “host” device could see or bid in auctions. BLE scanning handled access, while Hedera contracts enforced bid logic—creating a real-world gating mechanism.\n\nIn short, Proximity combines real-time, local hardware interaction with secure, chain-specific smart contracts, all wrapped in a rapidly iterable UI framework. Working with Rootstock, Hedera, and Flow gave us the ability to go beyond just “demoing” blockchain—they let us embed it in real-world interactions.\n\nLet us know if you want the auction, wallet, or social graph demo—we've got a BLE beacon ready. 😉",

This dapplet stores all tweets seen by the community on the fly into an IPFS storage. It also restores deleted tweets on the fly from the IPFS storage and enables retweet functionality if disabled by Twitter.\n\nThe project demonstrates a generic technology, how to enforce a decentralization for (almost) any existing web-based community, including its content, accounts and operations. Furthermore, it shows how communities can become self-sovereign and resistant to censorship and forcible profit extraction by the centrally owned hoster, even if this hoster is the creator of the community.\n\nThe project transforms the current paradigm of the owner-based web (where the website owner has total exclusive control over its community) into the new one. The new web paradigm balances the power of the website owner by the ability for a community to \"fork\" its data and services and \"redirect\" processing to another backend.\n\nDISCLAIMER: some ideas behind the Dapplets technology are new and require some time to grasp.",
    "how_its_made": "The project utilizes the Dapplets technology to create an augmenting application and IPFS for data storage. There is an existing Twitter Adapter, which parses the twitter website and exposes the website's semantic structure containing tweets and insertion points. The tweery dapplet utilizes the Twitter Adapter to crawl tweets and perform operations on them. The dapplet platform connects all parts together.\n\nWe have created the tweery dapplet, running on top of the tweeter website, and we have extended an existing Twitter adapter with necessary widgets and insertion points. A mapping between tweet id and the IPFS cid was temporarily implemented as a centralized service. It should be reimplemented later as a decentralized writable hashmap (or database).",

    "description": "Our product is an all-in-one Telegram bot designed to empower crypto traders with advanced, real-time data and seamless transaction functionality. It offers users the ability to gather valuable insights about any token by simply providing the token’s address. With its connection to the GeckoTerminal API, users can access up-to-the-minute data on a vast range of cryptocurrencies, making it easier to make informed trading decisions.\n\nThe bot doesn’t just stop at providing data. It also tracks large transactions made by whales, alerting users to significant market moves as they happen. Additionally, the bot provides real-time updates on cryptocurrency news, ensuring users are aware of crucial events or developments that could impact their investments. These features are aimed at eliminating the fragmented access to crypto information that traders typically experience by consolidating all necessary data into one platform.\n\nFurthermore, our Telegram bot integrates Fusion+, a cutting-edge cross-chain swapping protocol that enables users to perform token swaps instantly without the hassle of bridging between chains. This solution dramatically reduces the complexity and time required to swap tokens, allowing users to take action faster when they see favorable conditions. No more manual bridging or lengthy transfer times – the bot automates this process, making token swaps as smooth as possible.\n\nAdditionally, our product introduces a new feature that simplifies the token creation process. With just a few clicks, users can create their own tokens or meme coins, streamlining what has traditionally been a complex and technical process. This feature democratizes token creation, allowing anyone, regardless of their technical background, to enter the world of tokenomics and bring their ideas to life with ease.",
    "how_its_made": "Our project is built on a robust set of modern technologies that come together to create a seamless, real-time trading and token creation experience, all within a simple Telegram bot interface. At the core of the project is the Telegram Bot Framework, powered by node-telegram-bot-api. This framework allows the bot to interact with Telegram’s API, handling user inputs, executing token swaps, and sending important alerts. The bot operates in real-time, processing commands and executing backend API calls based on the information users provide. It acts as the central interface through which users can manage their token-related activities.\n\nTo ensure users have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information, we’ve integrated the GeckoTerminal API using Axios. This allows the bot to retrieve real-time token data, including critical metrics like price, market cap, and trading volume. Users simply provide a token address, and the bot responds with actionable insights, giving them an instant overview of the market’s state. The GeckoTerminal integration ensures that the bot can cover multiple tokens across different chains, enabling traders to make informed decisions across the entire crypto market.\n\nOne of the standout features of the bot is its ability to send whale transaction alerts, made possible by the integration of the Whale Alert API. This functionality monitors the blockchain for large transactions, often referred to as whale trades, that could influence market behavior. When a significant trade is detected, users are notified in real-time, enabling them to stay ahead of the market and react promptly to these high-impact transactions.\n\nIn addition to market alerts, the bot is equipped with real-time news updates sourced from the CryptoPanic API. This integration ensures that users are always informed about the latest developments in the cryptocurrency world, including regulatory changes, macroeconomic events, and other breaking news that could affect the market. By combining both data and news, the bot serves as a comprehensive tool for keeping users well-informed.\n\nAnother key functionality is cross-chain token swapping, made possible by the Fusion+ protocol. This integration eliminates the traditionally complex and cumbersome process of bridging tokens between chains by offering seamless, instant cross-chain swaps. Users can swap tokens between different blockchains with minimal effort, without the need for multiple transactions or manual steps. This feature is designed to streamline the trading experience, making it faster, simpler, and more user-friendly.\n\nIn addition to its trading capabilities, the bot also offers a unique token creation feature. Using custom scripts and predefined smart contract templates, users can create their own tokens or meme coins with a single command. The tool allows for on-the-go customization of token parameters such as supply, name, and symbol, simplifying the typically complex process of token creation. This makes token development accessible even to those without deep technical knowledge, empowering a wider audience to participate in the cryptocurrency space.\n\nOverall, this project brings together real-time data, cross-chain swapping, market alerts, news updates, and token creation into a single, easy-to-use platform, providing users with all the tools they need to navigate the complex world of cryptocurrency directly from Telegram.",

    "description": "The name Harpos, draws inspiration from Horus Harpocrate, the child-like representation of Horus in Egyptian mythology, with his finger placed on his lips, symbolizing strong privacy and anonymity.\n\nHarpos is a unique social network that grants users the option to remain completely anonymous, made possible through the implementation of Zero Knowledge proofs enabled by Sismo, as well as the utilization of the XMTP messaging protocol.\n\nUpon joining our platform, user logs in via Sismo's SSO, and create a ZK proof attesting the amount of USD stablecoins they possess. Additionally, they have the option to generate another ZK proof demonstrating their number of Twitter followers, which serves as proof of their influence.\n\nDuring their profile creation, users specify the languages they speak, their country of residence, skills, interests, their current goals, and a chosen handle. Subsequently, they can search for other users based on their desired criteria (profile criteria, amount of USD stablecoins held, number of Twitter followers, etc.). Following the search, users can exclusively engage in private chats (powered by XMTP) with those whose criteria align with their preferences.\n\nThe driving force behind Harpos stems from recognizing certain challenges prevalent in other social networks, including bot interactions, unsolicited sales pitches, and connections with individuals who do not share genuine interests. By empowering users to connect directly with like-minded individuals, based on their chosen criteria and ensuring the authenticity of their contacts, we aim to address these pain points.\n\nTo summarize, Harpos offers distinct advantages, including \"Efficiency in networking,\" \"Authenticity,\" and \"Privacy\".",
    "how_its_made": "Harpos' frontend is developed using TypeScript, VueJS, and Nuxt. In contrast, the backend is implemented as a REST API using NestJS. To facilitate profile matching, we have chosen to utilize a centralized database. However, we envision the possibility of leveraging IPFS for uploading profile data and utilizing a centralized database with a CRON job for synchronization, thereby indexing this information for faster processing.\n\nOur trust-building capabilities rely on Sismo technology. We have extensively explored their SDK to personalize our requests through optional claims, enabling users to select values that our backend can access and retrieve information from.\n\nTo ensure user anonymity, we create a wallet for each user, which serves as an XMTP proxy, effectively concealing their EOA. For an added layer of security, we encrypt their private key using a passphrase of their choice and store it securely in the database.",

    "description": "Taifei Bazaar invites users into an interactive, 2D multiplayer arena designed as a gamified DeFi journey, drawing inspiration from the lively atmosphere of Taiwanese night markets and the social dynamics of platforms like Gather Town. Entry into this pixel-art world is seamless: users connect their crypto wallets, which instantly grants them an avatar to navigate the vibrant digital bazaar.\n\nThe core experience revolves around exploration and interaction. As users guide their avatars through the market, they encounter various themed stalls. These aren't just static elements; each stall embodies a DeFaI (Decentralized Finance AI) Agent, representing specific DeFi protocols, financial tools, or support functions. Users can approach these agent-stalls and engage in intuitive interactions using either natural language speech or text input.\n\nFor the initial launch (or hackathon scope), the bazaar features seven distinct agent-stalls, offering a range of functionalities:\nCelo Swapping Agent: Facilitates token swaps directly on the Celo network.\nCelo Staking Agent: Allows users to stake Celo assets via integrated protocols.\nRootstock Swapping Agent: Enables token swaps on the Rootstock sidechain.\nRootstock Staking Agent: Provides staking capabilities for Rootstock assets.\nReal-Time Price Teller: An oracle agent providing current market prices for various cryptocurrencies.\nInformation / Support Hub: A helpdesk agent offering guidance and answering questions about the bazaar or DeFi concepts.\n\"Add Your Own Stall\" Kiosk: A conceptual placeholder or feature allowing users/protocols to potentially deploy their own agents in the future.\n\nInteraction with these agents is designed to be conversational. Users can issue voice commands like \"What is my ETH balance?\", \"What is the price of ETH right now?\", \"Swap my USDC for some MEMECOIN\", or \"Stake my assets with the highest yield provider.\" The DeFaI agent interprets these requests and prepares the necessary on-chain transaction.\n\nCrucially, user sovereignty over funds is maintained. While the AI agent interacts with smart contracts to execute actions, the user must always approve and sign the transaction using their connected wallet before any funds are moved or actions are performed on their behalf.\n\nBeyond DeFi interactions, Taifei Bazaar fosters a social environment. Users can create private rooms and share a unique 5-digit code, allowing friends or community members to join the same instance of the bazaar. Inside, they can see each other's avatars moving in real-time, react with various emoticons, and customize their avatar's display name.\n\nFurthermore, the bazaar includes a dedicated stall demonstrating cross-chain swap simulation between Celo and Rootstock, leveraging Hyperlane technology to showcase interoperability possibilities.\n\nFuture Scope: The vision extends to allowing external DeFi protocols to easily deploy their own branded DeFaI agents into the marketplace, expanding the available services, and enabling broader multichain support beyond Celo and Rootstock.",
    "how_its_made": "Taifei Bazaar is built using a modern web technology stack, carefully chosen to enable its unique blend of real-time interaction, AI, and blockchain functionality:\n\nFrontend Framework & UI:\nNext.js: The foundation is built on Next.js, a powerful React framework providing server-side rendering, static site generation, optimized routing, API route capabilities, and a streamlined developer experience for building complex web applications.\nTailwind CSS & Shadcn/UI: Styling is handled efficiently using Tailwind CSS for utility-first CSS, enabling rapid development of custom designs. Shadcn/UI is likely used as a component library or methodology, offering accessible and composable UI primitives built on top of Tailwind, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface for the bazaar, stalls, and modals.\n\nReal-Time Multiplayer Simulation:\nSocket.io: This library is the engine behind the live, multiplayer experience. It establishes persistent, low-latency, bidirectional communication channels between the server (potentially a Next.js API route or a separate Node.js server) and all connected clients. Socket.io handles broadcasting player positions, avatar appearances, emote triggers, and room state updates, making the virtual world feel dynamic and populated.\n\nBlockchain Integration & Smart Contracts:\nSolidity: The core logic for DeFi operations (like swapping and staking) that occur on the Celo and Rootstock networks resides in smart contracts written in Solidity, the standard language for EVM-compatible chains.\n\nCelo & Rootstock: These specific blockchains were chosen as the initial target networks where the DeFi agent-stalls execute their actions. Contracts deployed on these chains handle the actual asset management and protocol interactions.\nWallet Interaction (Frontend): Libraries like Privy, Wagmi, and Viem are used on the frontend to manage wallet connections, interact with the user's wallet for signing/approving transactions, and communicate with the Celo/Rootstock blockchain nodes (via RPC). Privy simplifies onboarding and authentication.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (DeFaI Agents):\nGOAT SDK: This Software Development Kit is employed to build the conversational AI capabilities of the DeFaI agent-stalls. It handles Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand user speech/text commands, manages conversational state, and determines the appropriate action (e.g., fetching data, preparing a blockchain transaction).\nEleven Labs API: To make the agents more interactive and immersive, the Eleven Labs API is integrated for high-quality Text-to-Speech (TTS). When an agent needs to respond or provide information verbally, the text output is sent to Eleven Labs, which generates realistic voice audio played back to the user.\n\nThis combination of technologies allows Taifei Bazaar to deliver a feature-rich experience that merges the visual engagement of a 2D game, the social connectivity of a multiplayer platform, the power of AI-driven interaction, and the trustless execution of blockchain technology.",

Samples may comprise elements such as rhythm, melody, speech, sounds, or entire bars of music, and maybe layered, equalized, sped up or slowed down, repitched, looped, or otherwise manipulated. Sampling is a tedious and manual process for producers because separating audio isn’t the easiest or most streamlined thing to do. Stems in music are packaged groups of multiple tracks that have been layered together. For example, a snare drum sound is a single track while a recording of an entire drum kit is a stem. Another is a single electric guitar track while four or five guitars are layered on top of one another in a stem. Independent artists can release stems and samples with a license that works for them and the purchaser.

    "description": "Clink Up is a Web3 Social Media that allows users to take full control of their data, allowing them to profit from the usage and selling of their own data, while handling seamless Cross-Chain payment to advertising merchants. Instead of social media platform profiting from their users' data with no control and transparency, Clink Up offers users a new Web3 alternative to offer full transparency and credibility when it comes to data usage and revenue distribution.\n\n\nKey Features:\n1. Reward Distribution for Using Users' Data\nWe reward users for using their data in 3 ways, namely:\n    - Recommendations (User’s data was used to help recommend content to another user based on user-user embedding similarity)\n    - Purchase (User’s content was used to help another user make a purchase, scaled by  influence score of the user’s content and the purchase made (using vector similarity))\n    - Training (User’s data was used to fine-tune and train our embedding models)\n\n2. Seamless Cross-Chain Payments\nWe allows users to pay for advertised products directly within the application itself, allowing users to use any kind of currency we support to pay for the merchant regardless of what kind of currency the merchant is demanding. We abstract all cross-chain payment complexity away from the user, making it a simple, seamless transaction.\n\n3. Wallet Address Abstraction\nAbstraction of wallet address allows for a seamless experience to transition onto our web3 application, similar to web2 applications usage of usernames. This lets users to not need to focus on wallet addresses and instead use readable ENS names instead.",
    "how_its_made": "Clink Up is powered by 3 main technologies, each for a distinct aspect of the platform, namely:\n\n- Nodit (For Reward Distribution and Multi-chain Queries)\n- Circle (For Cross-chain Transactions)\n- ENS (For Wallet Address and Profile Abstraction)\n\nNodit:\nWe have utilised Nodit's Webhook and Web3 Data APIs to power both the Reward Distribution flow and Multi-Chain Queries for our application.\nWe have deployed two smart contracts on Base, one for handling Pre-reward Distribution events and another for Post-reward Distribution events. Setting up a Nodit Webhook allows us to effectively fire requests to our backend whenever a reward is due (whenever a user's data is used for whatever purpose), parse it appropriately and process the rewards. Once successfully distributed, we log the reward details using our Post-reward smart contract. \nNodit's Web3 Data API allows us to also query these post-reward transactions to display to our users for transparency and cross-checking, while also being able to query multi-chain payment transactions from users since we also support cross-chain payments.\n\nCircle:\nTo simplify multi-chain transfers, we have harnessed the power of CCTP v2 to abstract away the complexity of cross-chain transactions.\nWe also support stable payments with USDC, which allows us to build on the price stability of USDC to ensure reliable, consistent value transfers.\nFurthermore, we enable users to pay transaction fees in USDC on Base, removing the need for native gas tokens.\n\nENS:\nWe use ENS to abstract away wallet addresses of merchants and users from our application, while also leveraging on Durin to cheaply deploy sub domains for our application without having to pay for expensive gas fees of L1 ENS.\n\n",

    "description": "Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and the rest are closed gardens; gardens where all the plants you sow are hidden behind a gate, and all the crops you harvest are owned by a publicly traded Corporation.\r\n\r\nIt’s time we throw open the gates and declare rightful ownership to our identities on the internet.\r\n\r\nThe Ether XP is the first step in a long process of giving user's ownership of their digital identity. \r\n\r\nThe Ether is a social platform that allows users to debate about Ethereum and answer questions related to our ecosystem. Whenever users writing compelling arguments or insightful answers, they are rewarded with The Ether's native reputation, XP. Our XP system is a representation of a user's Ethereum ecosystem insights. \r\n\r\nFor our hackathon project, we turned The Ether's XP into a non-transferrable NFT. In this way, user's can not only own their reputation that stems from their The Ether XP, but they can also take it with them to any Web 3.0 application. Just like reputation in real life, this tokenized reputation can not be transferred and will always be associated with the user through the NFT that lives in their wallet.\r\n\r\nWant to have a conference that is only for insightful Ethereans? Require entrants to that party to prove their insightfulness by displaying their eXP (The Ether XP for short) badge. \r\n\r\nEventually, we will have eXP for each community on The Ether (i.e. Core Dev, DeFi, Research, etc.), and then move beyond Ethereum based reputation. We are calling the larger reputation project TREP (tokenized reputation).\r\n\r\nBut what if a user loses their private keys to a nefarious actor? Or what if that user does something terrible on The Ether that causes them to lose reputation?\r\n\r\nIn these scenarios, a user will be sent an untrusted miscreant badge. This \"bad\" badge will show other users and Web 3.0 apps that this user's XP NFT has lost its integrity.",

    "description": "Messaging systems and apps such as whatsapp, telegram, wechat, facebook messenger and so many others have become ubiquitous nowadays. And not only that, but businesses and individuals have become partially dependent on these and we trust them because of the number of people that use them. With more than 3.6 billion people worldwide and over 145 billion messages being sent every day.\r\n\r\nThis has brought forth stratospheric market valuations.\r\nWhatsApp was acquired for $19 billion in 2014, Telegram has over 500 million users and rejected an investment offer at $30 billion. Skype was sold to Microsoft for $8.5 billion in 2011. And they will continue growing at a rate of 10% per year by 2030.\r\nBut there's a huge privacy problem in regards to siloed enterprises controlling data. These are regarding several right’s violations mainly around privacy such as Data sharing violations like the fine of 266 million euros that Whattsapp received by the EU in September last year, Telegram’s constant issues with cyber theft mainly around bank accounts and quite a large number of cases of Blackmail. And private data leaks such as the one that happened through facebook in April 2021.\r\nNevertheless, messaging companies are still operating under practices that suggest data governance has not been solved.\r\n\r\nData is the most valuable resource an individual has and through blockchain technology this privacy issue can be quenched. We think that the way to launch a competitor is through the DeFi ecosystem as it is growing at an incredible rate.\r\nHaving said that we decided to build it with the following characteristics:\r\n - Fully on-chain encrypted chat app,\r\n - Directly integrated with Polygon scan and built on Polygon.\r\n - Moralis managing everything from the backend for a faster implementation.\r\n - Will allow MATIC and MATIC-based token transfer between chatters!",

Deployed on the Base blockchain, our platform reimagines how digital billboards operate in the Web3 era by introducing intelligent automation at every level of the advertising process.\nAt the heart of our system lies a sophisticated dual-agent architecture powered by Coinbase's AI Agent Kit. The first agent serves as an intuitive interface for advertisers, eliminating traditional barriers to entry in the digital advertising space. Through natural language conversations, users can effortlessly create and mint advertising content as NFTs, without requiring direct interaction with cryptocurrency wallets. This agent handles everything from generating ad copy to creating AI-powered visuals, making digital billboard advertising accessible to everyone.\nOur second agent introduces unprecedented automation to the bidding process. Operating continuously in the background, this autonomous agent employs dynamic bidding strategies to secure optimal billboard placements for advertisers. It analyzes market conditions, adjusts tactics in real-time, and participates in dutch auctions within our PlaceHolder Marketplace, ensuring advertisers achieve their display objectives without manual intervention.\nThe technical infrastructure is built on a foundation of smart contracts that manage both the NFT minting process and our specialized marketplace. These contracts facilitate transparent, trustless transactions while maintaining the platform's autonomous nature. The physical display network consists of Raspberry Pi devices running custom Flutter applications, which monitor the blockchain in real-time and instantly display new advertisements as they're confirmed on-chain.\nTo maintain high advertising standards and publisher accountability, we've integrated True Network's attestation layer. This system collects and verifies user ratings for advertisements, computing reputation scores for publishers. These attestations are permanently recorded on the blockchain, creating a transparent and immutable record of advertising quality and publisher reliability.\nThis combination of autonomous agents, blockchain technology, and IoT infrastructure creates a self-sustaining advertising ecosystem that operates with minimal human intervention while maximizing efficiency and transparency for all participants. AgenticPlaceholder represents the future of digital outdoor advertising, where artificial intelligence and blockchain technology converge to create a more accessible, efficient, and accountable advertising landscape.",

    "description": "This project is a decentralized AI model hub built on Web3 that enables anyone to upload, discover, and interact with AI models in a secure and transparent environment. Users connect their crypto wallets to access the platform, where we have integrated Polygon’s x402 protocol for smart payments. From there, they can explore a wide range of AI models and run them directly within an interactive live playground powered by Fluence.\n\nAll model files are stored on Walrus decentralized storage, ensuring permanence and accessibility. The Fluence runtime drives model execution, delivering streaming outputs and configurable parameters. On-chain smart payments via Polygon x402 allow seamless, usage-based transactions with flexible pricing models.\n\nThe frontend is built with React + TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced by Framer Motion for smooth interactions and a modern user experience. Users can browse models, search by type or cost, view detailed information, and securely transact before launching the playground. An upload portal enables developers to contribute their models, set usage options, and publish them directly to the hub.\n\nOur mission is to establish a trustless, user-centric AI ecosystem that unites the principles of decentralization with the capabilities of modern AI, delivering a next-generation experience for both creators and users.",
    "how_its_made": "Our platform is built on a modern, component-based architecture using React with TypeScript, providing robust type safety and an enhanced developer experience. The user interface leverages Tailwind CSS for consistent design patterns and Framer Motion for fluid animations and micro-interactions that enhance user engagement throughout the platform.\nThe frontend follows a modular component architecture with reusable elements including ModelCard, WalletModal, and ChatUI components. This approach ensures code maintainability and consistency across the platform while enabling rapid feature development and maintaining a cohesive user experience.\nWeb3 functionality is implemented through a comprehensive integration stack utilizing wagmi and ethers.js for blockchain interactions and smart contract communication, web3modal for seamless wallet connectivity across multiple providers, and Polygon network as the default chain for cost-effective transactions. The platform integrates the x402 protocol to enable programmable micropayments, allowing creators to monetize model usage while providing users with granular payment control.\nModel storage and retrieval is powered by Walrus, a decentralized storage network. We developed a lightweight client wrapper that provides progress tracking for upload operations, manifest generation and retrieval, and accessible link management for stored models. Model execution runs on Fluence, a decentralized compute platform, with our custom-built client library handling session initialization and management, real-time output streaming, runtime parameter configuration, and interactive playground functionality for model testing.\nThe codebase maintains high reliability through comprehensive testing using Jest and React Testing Library, focusing on critical user flows and component behavior validation. During the rapid development phase, we implemented a strategic prototyping approach by creating mock implementations for Walrus and Fluence clients to enable parallel development, stubbing payment flows using ethers.js for UI/UX validation, and maintaining production-ready architecture patterns to facilitate seamless integration of live services. This approach allowed for accelerated development while ensuring the underlying architecture could support full production deployment without significant refactoring.",

This means the proof of personhood is stored on the blockchain and is verified against the WorldId contract. If the verification matches the data from the WorldId contract, the personhood is confirmed and only then, we permit the fund withdrawal operation.\n\nSmart Contract\n\nThe smart contract uses the World ID proof to make a valid payment to any recipient MetaMask wallet.\n\nOff-ramp\n\nEach recipient is able to convert crypto to cash seamlessly with Unlimit integration.

    "description": "We built LFG (Looking For Group) as a decentralized talent matching platform that utilizes smart contracts for efficient job management and payment handling. \n\nThe onboarding process begins by deploying a personal Virtual Smart Agent (VSA) through a chosen client (Telegram, Discord, Web App, and more). During this onboarding, the agent employs a chat-style interface to gather important profile information, such as your role (developer, project owner, or both), technical skills (e.g., Rust, Solidity, React), availability, and past experiences via platforms like GitHub or through brief coding challenges. The process integrates Privy to securely connect your wallet, ensuring that all on-chain interactions are linked to your verified identity.\n\nOnce deployed, your VSA functions as an autonomous representative. It continuously scans the network for bounties that match your skill set and preferences. For instance, if you are a Rust developer, your agent will filter and identify bounty postings specific to Rust. When a suitable bounty is located, your agent automatically negotiates and accepts the task on your behalf, locking the required funds into an on-chain BountyEscrow contract. This escrow mechanism guarantees trustless and secure payments: upon successful completion of the task and verification by the bounty owner, the contract releases the reward (minus a small platform fee) directly to your wallet.\n\nTo ensure quality, our system includes a verification process. Developers are asked to submit a brief code snippet or complete a mini technical quiz. Successful verification triggers the minting of a verification NFT (or soulbound token) that serves as a skill badge in your wallet—enhancing your matching priority and building trust within the network.\n\nWhile our current focus is on automating the matching of developers to bounties, LFG is designed with long-term scalability in mind. We envision a complete ecosystem where specialized VSAs cater to various industries—from blockchain alpha group vetting to hobbyist communities and beyond. At the core of this future is “Nexus,” an overarching coordinating agent that will enable advanced functionalities such as multi-signature escrow releases and seamless collaboration across industries.\n\nIn summary, LFG automates the entire opportunity matching process—from intelligent onboarding and skill verification to automated bounty matching and secure on-chain payments—providing a frictionless, trustless, and highly efficient way for individuals to tap into unrealized synergies and opportunities.",
    "how_its_made": "Our core system, deployed on Sepolia, features a comprehensive smart contract (0x12cc7215E334BA6d89A57460AB94d37C1B5B54a3) that facilitates user registration , job creation with escrow, job acceptance tracking, payment release, and dispute resolution while also collecting platform fees.\n\nA key aspect of our platform is the user management and reputation system, which maintains an on-chain record of users, tracks completed jobs, and allows for rating submissions that impact reputation scores. The job management aspect ensures secure fund locking during job creation, tracks job acceptance with enforced deadlines, and includes mechanisms for completion verification and payment release.\n\nTo address disputes, we developed a system for initiating disagreements that features automated rating adjustments based on outcomes and allows for contract owner arbitration. Economically, the platform automatically collects fees from successful job completions, ensuring sustainability.\n\nWhat sets our implementation apart is the integration of Virtual Smart Agents (VSAs) that mediate all smart contract interactions, triggering functions based on user actions and creating a seamless interface between users and the blockchain. This innovation extends to automated dispute handling, which ties the impact on reputation directly to the results of disputes.\n\nWe prioritized security with features like deadline-based verification and a reliable escrow system, ensuring protection for both parties involved. By choosing the Sepolia testnet for our deployment, we minimized transaction costs during testing and designed a reputation system that encourages positive behavior.\n\nWe forked and customized the ElizaOS framework to build our Virtual Smart Agents (VSAs), enhancing it with specialized plugins and adapters for seamless blockchain integration. Our system is designed with a microservices architecture and utilizes Docker containerization, hosted on Autonomous for efficient and scalable agent deployment.\n\nOn the frontend, we opted for Next.js and React, styled it using Tailwind CSS, and deployed everything on Vercel to ensure optimal performance. For our blockchain and security needs, we implemented Nillion to maintain privacy-preserving on-chain data storage, particularly for sensitive user information. Additionally, we developed custom smart contracts for BountyEscrow, enabling secure and trustless payments.\n\nIn terms of our development stack, the frontend utilizes Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. For the backend, we’re using Node.js version 18 or higher, with a database setup that combines on-chain storage through Nillion and traditional databases. Our testing is thorough, with a comprehensive test suite utilizing Vitest and Jest. Lastly, we manage our packages with PNPM, taking advantage of workspace support for effective monorepo management.\n\nOverall, our platform exemplifies how blockchain technology can effectively address real-world challenges in the talent marketplace, providing a trustless environment that is accessible to non-technical users through our automated workflows.",

    "description": "Noodles.fun emerges as a revolutionary platform where the speculative market meets the fun and community-centric ethos of Twitter. The platform was conceived from the observation that while Twitter is a powerhouse for visibility, creators often struggle to monetize their presence effectively due to numerous intermediaries like marketing and PR agencies.\n\nIntroducing Noodles.fun: \nUsers can speculate on creators’ visibility and once they become stakeholders of a visibility share, they are able to buy direct exposure from the creator’s Twitter account. On the other hand, the creator earns fees from trades on the bonding curve and direct payment for giving Twitter exposure to users.\nTo onboard the platform, users use Privy to connect their Twitter account, which generates a new wallet linked to our app. After topping up this wallet with some Ethereum (ETH), users can start trading creators’ visibility shares. The platform employs a bonding curve to fairly price the visibility of a creator, providing users with a liquid asset that makes speculation more appealing.\nOnce a user owns a visibility share, they can use it to negotiate for exposure. This exposure comes in the form of a Twitter post. Both the creator and the user must agree on the content that will be promoted. Upon agreement, the promotional tweet is shared in the Noodles.fun app, showcasing the exposure agreement.\n",
    "how_its_made": "For onboarding, we've partnered with Privy, which facilitates account abstraction. Privy generates a unique ETH address for each Twitter account, allowing speculation on creators' visibility before they join. Trading fees are locked in the creator's linked smart contract and claimable upon joining, making for a truly permissionless system.\n\nRegarding our blockchain choices, we've developed on both Scroll and Neon EVM to engage with diverse communities. For Neon EVM, we utilize Blockscout for monitoring smart contract interactions, including transactions, and for manual interaction with smart contracts. \n\nAdditionally, we leverage The Graph to access the trading history of each user within our application. This tool also helps in retrieving data about twitter post requests to creators, promoting a more decentralized approach by not relying on traditional databases.",

    "description": "Our team finds most exercise options and routines boring.  We all played sports competitively and we are looking for a sports like experience when we workout thats quick and fun.  One thing we noticed with most digital experiences was that they were missing key components of a real sporting event.  The three components we have decided to focus on this project are:  judging, prizes, and documenting the event.  We believe that web3 provides us with tools to make these areas scalable.  The basic premise of our app is a user can choose to participate in a quick 60 second challenge (example: most pushups reps) or choose to be a judge by watching player video submissions and give official rep counts.  Players must pay with our own Dojo tokens in order to play and show commitment.  These dojo tokens become part of a larger pool that is used to reward judges.  Last but not least the winner of this weekly event receives an NFT of their performance.  In order to ensure accuracy we require that at least three judges agree on the rep count.  In the future we hope to expand the challenges, build scalable contracts that can be used by anyone to run an event, incorporate other verification schemes (computer vision, oracles for judging credentials) and incentivize community participation by building a token with real monetary value and utility. ",
    "how_its_made": "This is our first time working with web3 technologies as our background is mainly as full stack devs with a focus on flutter development.  We built a mobile app that records video and uses Firebase as a CDN and datastore. On the web3 side we used the Moralis web API to verify token payments. We used NFTport's API to save video files to IPFS and also to mint NFTs.  In order to mint our Dojo tokens we created our own contract using Remix and used Infura as an RPC server to distribute rewards to judges.  Without the sponsors tech we would have never been able to integrate this all this functionality into a flutter mobile app. I think we surprised ourselves building a video fitness game with these web3 components in a week and most importantly are hooked on web3.",

    "description": "AxelART is a groundbreaking platform that merges AI-generated art with blockchain technology, seamlessly combining web 2.0 social features such as liking, commenting, and sharing, with web 3.0 functionalities that allow users to mint their AI creations as NFTs on various blockchain networks. The platform simplifies the NFT minting process through Account Abstraction and offers diverse login options, including social, email, and wallet integration. Behind the scenes, it leverages Safe, Axelar, and The Graph to create a secure and user-friendly environment for art creation and ownership, while also introducing a unique pAInt Super Token for real-time streaming. AxelART redefines the artistic experience, making it accessible and engaging for a global community of artists and art enthusiasts.\n",
    "how_its_made": "Technologies Used:\n\nFrontend Client App: The frontend is a web application hosted at https://axelart.xyz. It is primarily built using JavaScript and interfaces with AxelART server APIs. It utilizes the web3auth SDK for authentication.\n\nServer APIs and Datastore: AxelART relies on Google Firebase services, including Firestore for data storage, Firebase Storage for image storage, and Firebase Functions for serverless backend functions.\n\nEthereum Smart Contracts: Three Solidity smart contracts play crucial roles in the project:\n\nAIrtNFT.sol: An ERC721 NFT contract with support for ERC2771Context for secure permission-based function calls. This contract powers minting, collecting, and transferring of pAInt or WETH tokens.\n\nTransporter.sol: A Transport contract that sends and receives NFTs between multiple AIrtNFT.sol contracts across different chains using General Messaging Passing (GMP) on the Axelar Network.\n\nAIrtNFTFactory.sol: A factory contract used for deploying minimal clones of AIrtNFT.sol and Transporter.sol contracts, efficiently creating new instances when needed.\n\nStreamer.sol: A contract leveraging the Superfluid protocol to enable streaming of the pAInt utility token. It is only deployed on the home chain.\n\nHow They're Pieced Together:\n\nThe frontend app interfaces with the server APIs to fetch and render data stored in Firestore, including user data, posts, and social interactions.\n\nWeb3Auth is used for user authentication, allowing multiple login methods, including social, email, and wallet.\n\nSmart contracts facilitate NFT minting, transfer, and transport between chains. The Axelar Network's General Messaging Passing (GMP) technology enables this seamless interaction across multiple blockchains.\n\nAxelART integrates the Safe{Core} Protocol for secure digital ownership and Account Abstraction, eliminating the need for users to handle complex seed phrases.\n\nGelato Relay is used for signing and executing transactions. It simplifies the process by allowing the platform to pay for users' transactions and provide a gasless minting experience.\n\nStripe Billing is integrated for AIrtist PRO subscriptions, providing a convenient way for users to access premium features.\n\nNotable Hacks:\n\nOne notable aspect is the use of minimal clones for deploying AIrtNFT contracts for PRO users. This approach minimizes gas costs and streamlines the deployment process. Additionally, the platform accurately predicts a user's Safe address, even before it's deployed, ensuring that creators can receive payments even before their first minting.\n\nOverall, AxelART's architecture and technology stack create a cohesive and user-friendly environment where AI-generated art meets blockchain and web3, revolutionizing the artistic experience for its users.",

    "description": "I wanted to join a loyalty program of a fast-food nearby and for the enrollment they asked me to provide my email address, phone number, billing address and birth date. Businesses ask for too much information. And then, with many loyalty programs your wallet gets overstuffed. You get all these annoying SMS, emails, calls like \"Happy birthday, would you like a 10% discount for your meal?\" In addition, setting up these loyalty programs cost a lot for businesses. This is why we came up with Loyo. We built the application from scratch during the hackathon.\n\nAfter a research we figured out, that we're not the one to suffer from this problem:\n\n- \"26% of consumers report that the brand asks for too much information or the enrollment process takes too long|\" : KobieMarketing\n\n- \"71 % of shoppers say they would be more likely to use their loyalty cards if they could access these cards and rewards from their mobile phone\" : report by ebbo.com\n\n- \"54% of loyalty memberships are inactive. Companies spend billions of dollars on loyalty programs every year, but that seems wasteful\" - report by Capgemini\n\nWith Loyo, customers are never asked for their personal information. Instead we use Ethereum smart wallet (exactly ERC-4337 abstracted wallet with paymaster) to identify the client. On Loyo you can get the loyalty rewards using the only one QR code everywhere. And then inside the app, you can your spend your loyalty points on a coffee, or send them to your friends with a certain limit. \n\nYou may ask yourself why businesses will switch to Loyo? At first, it's extremely cheap and easy compared to building and developing something in-house. But it's not the only reason.\n\nLet's talk about decentralized data! Every time a customer purchases a cup of coffee, or any other item, it's tracked on the Tableland database. Then businesses that use Loyo gain the privilege of accessing this invaluable database which is a gold mine of data insights.\n\nTo say it shorter, with the invisible blockchain integration for both user and business, we're solving a bunch of common loyalty infrastructure problems.",
    "how_its_made": "When a merchant wants to use Loyo, he will use the web application to deploy his entity on the EVM chain. A business is represented as an ERC-20 token with some additional metadata about the business. - https://github.com/luaroncrew/ETH_Global_Online_Loyo/blob/main/contracts/Shop.sol\n\nSo, the merchant's business = ERC20 token 💸. Later in the explanation I will refer to a business smart contract as Shop.\n\nA merchant can distribute his token the way it wants and the way it defines, as Shop implements the ERC20 standard and the merchant is it's owner 🧑‍💻. \n\nClients of the merchant may install the Loyo mobile application built using ReactNative (accessible on both IOS and Android devices)\n-https://github.com/luaroncrew/ETH_Global_Online_Loyo/tree/main/mobile-app\n\n This application allows them to check how many loyalty points they have for different Shops, spend them or send to other people registered in Loyo. The ERC-4337 smart contract wallet is the game changer here 💪! Using ERC-4337 we implemented the gasless transactions (so that the users don't even understand that all happens on the blockchain).\n- https://github.com/luaroncrew/ETH_Global_Online_Loyo/blob/main/pre-bundler-backend/src/pre-bundler/user-operation/service.ts#L44\n\nThe creation of UserOperations is made possible thanks to userop.js library maintained by stackup. We also use their bundler and paymaster to handle and execute trascations on Polygon\n\nWe also may use some restrictions on the abstracted accounts, for example to prevent people from creating loyalty points DEX and use them. The diagram of loyalty sending with details is included to the submission.\n\nWe also have an Express backend server that collects the UserOperations (ERC-4337 transactions), parse them before sending to Bundler (executor of ERC-4337 transcations). This server writes all the transactions to a decentralized @Tableland database, so that the businesses can later analyze the activity of Loyo users.\n-https://github.com/luaroncrew/ETH_Global_Online_Loyo/blob/main/pre-bundler-backend/src/pre-bundler/user-operation/service.ts#L127\n\nThe UserOperation handling is implemented in the way it's chain-agnostic. That means, we can deploy Loyo on any EVM chain. Currently Loyo is deployed on @Polygon, @Mantle, @Scroll",

We've also deployed on our Issuer Node to issue Verifiable Credentials with a custom eCommerce schema.\n\n5) Store Mockup\nBuilt with nextJS, tailwind \n\nRepository: https://github.com/shopconnectorg/shopconnect\n\nDISCLAIMER - Scope of implementation:\n\nEven though we wanted to achieve the full flow, including verifications, and that we built all the components in order to achieve it, our best efforts didn't match the time required for it, so for that reason we have partially simulated how it would actually work.\n\nWe have created the architecture of the real-world implementation, with two APIs, an e-commerce store, and a browser extension. We have achieved bidirectional communication between the browser extension and the backend, and partially implemented the required Polygon ID actions on the backend.\n\nOn the demo, however, the applied promotions are fetched from the APIs, but the application of promotions (or verification of VCs), as well as the emission of the proof of purchase, are simulated. The components were indeed built and developed, but we didn't manage to achieve full integration with testing due to time limitations.\n\nTechnical architecture details and flowchart:\nhttps://github.com/shopconnectorg/\n\nPresentation Slides linked here:\nhttps://www.canva.com/design/DAFxrK9bQxU/Qdv7QyP7a_RwDAR9vZZqDQ/edit?utm_content=DAFxrK9bQxU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton",

These therapists can identify connections between childhood experiences, life events, and dream themes, linking them to therapy discussions. Lumina analyzes dreams, revealing themes and potential meanings behind various elements.\nAdditionally, the app offers audio packs that guide dreams in specific directions while users sleep, including dream storylines, subliminal messaging, and AI-generated sleep audio. Users can create dreamsculpting stories with specific themes and names, and can simply fall asleep to these narratives. The app's features extend to guided dream sculpting with planned audio that plays at certain points during sleep, sleep tracking, meditation, and horoscope integration.\nIn the \"About Yourself\" section, users can share their life stories and incorporate horoscope themes, receiving weekly or daily horoscope readings linked to their personal experiences. Lumina addresses significant issues: it provides accessible therapy without the high costs of live sessions, requiring no insurance, and allows users to engage in therapy on their own schedules, eliminating the need for pre-scheduled appointments. It also supports individuals dealing with unresolved childhood trauma, nightmares, and night terrors, with plans to include a meditation feature.\nLumina is designed to solve the pressing issue of data sensitivity in the medical world by ensuring users have control over their information. Sensitive data is encrypted and securely stored, addressing the widespread concerns of data breaches in mental health services. By offering a solution that prioritizes user ownership of data, Lumina stands out as a safer alternative to competitors like BetterHelp and Aura.\nWith the potential for infinite use cases and monetization strategies, Lumina represents a transformative step forward in mental health support. After deploying this product, the world can expect enhanced privacy in mental health care, greater accessibility to therapy, and improved overall well-being for users.\nLumina also features a unique data pool option, allowing users to voluntarily share their anonymized data to discover others facing similar challenges. This feature enables the AI to connect users with like-minded individuals, fostering a sense of community and support. By engaging with others who have shared experiences, users can gain valuable insights and encouragement on their mental health journeys.\nTo enhance user engagement, Lumina includes daily prompts that encourage users to reflect and journal regularly. By responding to these prompts, users can earn rewards that unlock new features and functionalities within the app. This gamified approach not only motivates consistent journaling but also promotes healthy habits. After answering their daily prompts, users have the option to meditate, further supporting their mental well-being and enhancing their overall experience with the app.\n\nDemo Video here: https://youtu.be/cqBXG5GA5Hk?si=L5s--c8qCgYGzzX4\n",

Express allows for scalability and flexibility in managing these requests.\nNext.js: For our front-end, we use Next.js, which communicates with the Omi AI plugin through API routes for SSR and dynamic loading of the AI’s responses. This enables fast interaction without reloading pages and allows us to easily manage different states (such as ongoing therapy sessions).\n\n2. Data Encryption with Lit Protocol\nAfter users log their therapy sessions, journals, or dreams, the raw data is immediately encrypted using Lit Protocol. Lit Protocol is a decentralized access control protocol that ensures sensitive user data can only be accessed with the proper decryption keys. Here's how it works in detail:\n\nEncryption Process:\nAES Encryption: Once the data is logged, we encrypt it using AES-256 in the browser before it even reaches our servers. This guarantees that the data is secure during transit.\nLit Protocol Access Control: We use Lit Protocol's SDK to wrap the encrypted data in a decentralized access control layer. Users control the access keys and can decide who can decrypt their data.\n\nEthereum Wallet Integration: User authentication for encryption/decryption is handled via an Ethereum wallet connection. The private key of the user’s wallet plays a key role in controlling access, ensuring that no one without the user’s permission can view the encrypted data.\n\nTech Stack for Encryption:\nLit Protocol SDK: Integrated within the Next.js app, allowing for seamless encryption and key management directly from the front-end.\nEthereum Wallet (MetaMask): Users connect their wallets, which control the encryption/decryption process via Lit Protocol.\n\n3. Data Storage via Walrus/Sign\nOnce the data is encrypted, it’s passed to storage protocols like Walrus or Sign. These decentralized storage solutions offer both scalability and security. We implemented these protocols to ensure that user data remains off centralized servers and is distributed in a way that only authorized entities can access it.\n\nStorage Process:\n\nWalrus/Sign IPFS Integration: Data is stored using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) through Walrus/Sign. The encrypted data blobs are uploaded to IPFS, with a unique hash generated for each file.\n\nDecentralized Access Management: Only users with the correct encryption keys can retrieve and decrypt the data from IPFS. This decentralized storage approach minimizes the risk of data breaches, as no single entity holds the complete unencrypted dataset.\nTech Stack for Storage:\n\nIPFS (via Walrus/Sign SDKs): IPFS is used to store the actual encrypted data. These SDKs ensure that files are correctly pinned and retrievable.\nEthereum Smart Contracts: Some of the access control logic is managed via smart contracts, ensuring that data retrieval and permissions are auditable on the blockchain.\n\n4. Messaging System with XMTP\nFor user-to-user communication, especially for those who wish to connect anonymously over shared experiences, we integrated the XMTP (Extensible Message Transport Protocol). This decentralized protocol enables end-to-end encrypted messaging across wallets.\n\nMessaging Process:\n\nAnonymity: Users communicate using wallet addresses, ensuring that their real identity remains anonymous. XMTP enables messages to be linked to a user’s Ethereum wallet without revealing their actual identity.\nOpt-In Communication: Users can opt in to communicate with others who have logged similar dreams or experiences. We built a match-making algorithm that identifies overlapping themes and triggers potential connections between users.\nMessage Encryption: XMTP ensures that all messages are end-to-end encrypted. Even our servers never have access to the plaintext messages.\nTech Stack for Messaging:\n\nXMTP SDK: Integrated directly into the Next.js app to manage message encryption, decryption, and wallet-based communication.\nNext.js API Routes: Used to handle the initialization of messaging sessions, establishing connections between users based on shared themes.\n\n5. Hacky/Notable Aspects\nHacky Storage Encryption Workflow: To make encryption ultra-fast, we implemented client-side encryption before data hits the server. By using the Crypto API directly in the browser, we can ensure that even if the connection is compromised, the data is still inaccessible.\nDecentralized Messaging System: We had to hack around the XMTP SDK’s message storage and retrieval systems, making sure users could send encrypted messages that remain invisible even to us, the developers. This was done using a combination of local message queuing and XMTP routing.\n\nData Deletion Protocol: We created a custom protocol where users can request to fully delete their encrypted data from all nodes storing it, leveraging smart contracts to track the deletion process. We ensure that once deleted, the data’s encryption keys are also revoked, making the data permanently inaccessible.\n\nConclusion\nThis project is a powerful combination of decentralized storage, end-to-end encryption, and AI-powered therapy. By using Omi AI, Lit Protocol, Walrus/Sign, and XMTP, we’ve built a secure, privacy-first platform where users can safely engage in therapy, log personal experiences, and connect with others anonymously without compromising their data.\n\n",

    "description": "This project combines the simplicity of traditional expense splitting apps with the power of Web3 infrastructure to create a seamless, gasless experience for group expense management. By leveraging Circle's Modular Wallet SDK, we eliminate the traditional barriers of gas fees and private key management while maintaining enterprise-grade security through passkey authentication and compliance screening. The application transforms complex blockchain interactions into intuitive peer-to-peer payments, batch settlements, and real-time expense tracking - all without requiring users to understand crypto mechanics or manage gas fees. Built on Base Sepolia with USDC token integration, the system automatically handles gas payments through Circle's Paymaster when users exceed their free gasless transaction limit, ensuring a frictionless experience that scales from casual group expenses to complex multi-party settlements. The built-in compliance screening provides enterprise-level security by automatically blocking transactions to flagged addresses, making it suitable for both personal and business use cases while maintaining the familiar interface of popular expense management tools.",
    "how_its_made": "This project uses Circle Modular Wallet SDK to deploy embedded smart accounts. I wanted to build something with modular smart account and use modules like passkeys and session keys. Passkey authentication is powerful to onboard users who do not need or want to manage private keys. besides ERC6900 smart accounts (I am also keen to use ERC7579 smart account to leverage readily available modules like session key, co-signer ownable validator which I will continue working in other branch to have more stuff on-chain and allow sessions on my app), it uses Circle's sponsorship and USDC paymaster for gasless/eth-less transactions. Built real-time address screening using Circle's compliance APIs.  Implemented a dual-mode transaction system that automatically selects between gasless and USDC gas payments based on user transaction history. This project has also largely used Viem's account abstraction. I have implemented local storage for keeping expenses but those could be stored on-chain. Also, I would like to keep compliance checks as delegated signer who performs checks and provides signature and integrate multi factory validation module to smart account. I have also explored solutions to plugin session key module or upgrading embedded EOA (say privy) to modular smart account using EIP7702 and leverage more features(continuing on that..).\n\nplease check video here (have not been able to upload): https://www.loom.com/share/45e7986dcddf4b239301816a80bed9f8?sid=7f5958df-fbc3-4c26-b452-2adaedb3da6b",

Our project is perfect for selling financial research from research firms or sharing confidential information from commercial organizations. Our solution can also protect government information.\n\nThe platform comes with built-in anti-piracy mechanisms. We create a unique watermark for each user, which we embed into the content using LSB steganography technology. Thus, if someone compromises the content and publishes it openly, the author can decode the recipient and remove them from the content consumer list for copyright infringement.\n____________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Motivation**\n\nThe experience of one of our team members, who created and sold DeFi Yield Farming research in a private community, inspired our idea.

The content creator uploads their material to the platform. \n2. The platform embeds an invisible watermark into the content. \n3. The platform provides a link for content distribution. \n4. The content creator shares this content with subscribers.\n5. Subscribers send a request for access to the content. \n6. The content creator confirms or denies the request. \n7. Subscribers gain access and can view the content.\n\n\n**Here's how the process of finding and blocking pirates works:**\n1. The content creator finds their content openly available. \n2. The creator uploads compromised content to the platform. \n3. The platform decodes the original recipient's address from the content. \n4. The content creator removes the pirate from the subscriber list.\n____________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Monetization and Growth**\n\nIf we win the ETH Global Paris hackathon with this idea, we will continue to validate it and look for a product-market fit for Whataproof. Regarding functionality, we plan to integrate invisible watermarks into text, audio, and video files. We will implement decentralized payment systems, such as Curra.io.\n\nIn the full version of our product, we plan to incentivize users further to protect content from piracy. Subscribers will make an anti-piracy deposit to gain access to the content. Anyone can check the compromised file and receive a reward for detecting pirates.\n\nFrom the moment of launch and integration of payment systems, our platform will be able to charge 1% of the volume of content sales by creators as a fee for using our platform.\n____________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Architecture**\n\nObjective: Develop a system to enable intermediary-free distribution of private content copies between the distributor and clients, focusing on client identification and data privacy.

For example, in India, the supercoin by Flipkart and insider points on Myntra and Paytm first rewards on Paytm. Government banks like SBI also give loyalty rewards. But still, the loyalty program is not at its fullest, reasons are-  low redemption rate, every company issues their loyalty point, some companies do not have the digital infrastructure, redemption requires a threshold value.\r\n\r\nTo counter this problem, we are creating a token and a platform, LoyFin. Companies can buy these tokens and then distribute them to their customers/ employees as loyalty rewards from our website. There will be several other functionalities like a company dashboard, where token can be bought with fiat currencies and USDC tokens. There will be another unique functionality of \"streaming rewards\" on our website, where rewards can be rewarded to people continuously for a certain period at a specified rate of transfer (opening endless use cases for corporate and consumers). Later these tokens can then be redeemed by consumers or token holders at several marketplaces, supermarkets, and can also be traded among peers as gift rewards. (example - Token holders can redeem airline tickets, movie tickets, e-commerce platforms can add the provision for redeemable items between different vendors, etc ) Finally, the vendors will be able to convert these tokens to fiat currencies through our website. The entire system will be decentralized and a blockchain-based system will make it easy to add and remove partner companies and vendors.",

We used Rinkeby/ Kovan test networks to deploy our smart contracts(ERC-20) and then used the same to list the token in UNISWAP. Uniswap will further be integrated into our dapp for our customers to swap their native tokens(USDC/USDT) in exchange for LFN loyalty tokens.",

They can then select the features they require in their smart contract using the low-code interface. The project will then automatically generate a Solidity smart contract with minimum functionalities. Institutes can download the smart contract, edit it if needed, and then upload it back to the project. The project will then deploy the smart contract on the Mantle chain.\n\nOnce the smart contract is deployed, institutes can interact with it from their own websites using the project's API support. For example, if a member wants to purchase a membership from an institute's marketplace page, the institute can call the project's transferOwnership() API to transfer ownership of the NFT to the member's wallet address.\n\nNFT owners can visit the event page to check the event date, time, and other details. When they click the \"Enter event\" button, the project will check if the current wallet address is one of the owners of the NFT. If it is, the project will allow the user to access the event page.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe project's NFT-based membership program will revolutionize the way institutes create and manage memberships for their members. It will make it easy for institutes to create secure and tamper-proof NFT memberships, and for members to purchase and use them. The project's API support will also allow institutes to interact with NFT memberships from their own websites, giving them more control over their membership programs.",

    "description": "The scarcity of medical images for training AI models poses a significant barrier to the progress of medical research and the development of precise AI-driven healthcare solutions. Without access to diverse and representative datasets, AI models struggle to accurately diagnose diseases, analyze medical conditions, and provide personalized treatment plans. This shortage impedes researchers' ability to unlock the full potential of AI in the healthcare domain, hindering advancements in diagnostics, treatment, and patient outcomes. MedDAO is an innovative decentralized autonomous organization that aims to address this critical issue of the global shortage of medical images required for training AI models in the healthcare domain. By revolutionizing the paradigm of patient-researcher interactions and transforming the landscape of medical data accessibility, MedDAO provides a comprehensive solution to these challenges. Let's discuss the features of MedDAO step-by-step:\n\n- Incentivization: MedDAO incentivizes patients to contribute their medical data by offering a fair compensation mechanism. Patients receive monetary rewards for selling their medical files, encouraging their active participation in building comprehensive datasets. Patients are able to see the compensation price per submission which they can claim after their submission is approved by the aggregator. This incentivization model fosters the creation of diverse and representative datasets, enabling researchers to train AI models effectively and achieve significant advancements in medical research and treatment methodologies.\n\n- Aggregation: MedDAO incorporates a system of aggregators who play a crucial role in regulating the DAO ecosystem. These aggregators analyze the medical markets, assess researchers' demands, and optimize requests for medical files to form data sets or collections. By dynamically adjusting pricing structures based on factors such as data complexity and clinical relevance, aggregators ensure fairness and transparency in the marketplace. They also validate the quality and authenticity of files submitted to different datasets, maintaining the integrity of the platform. Researchers also have the option to schedule a decentralized video-call with aggregators to discuss custom dataset requests.\n\n- Privacy and Security: MedDAO places utmost importance on protecting patient privacy and ensuring data security.  To maintain confidentiality, researchers and companies are never granted complete access to the medical files. Instead, our platform offers a secure Bacalhau endpoint, where researchers can submit their algorithms or code for execution on the specified dataset. The endpoint securely executes the code and provides researchers with the results, without exposing the underlying medical images. Apart from this all data on MedDAO is end-to-end encrypted. These robust privacy-preserving mechanisms prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity.\n",
    "how_its_made": "The application is built on state of the art tech stack. The front end is built on nextjs framework. Patient, aggregator and researchers are authenticated via metamask. ENS is integrated here to show the equivalent ens name of the authenticated  user. The smart contracts are deployed on ethereum testnet in the absence of a working and compatible filecoin test net. The smart contracts are integrated with the front end using etherjs. \n\nFiles uploaded by patients is encrypted by lit protocol and pushed to spheron. All notifications are implemented via integration with push protocol. The decentralized compute platform is offered by bacalhau. \n\nBacalhau offers a client that runs on an user's system to interact with the bacalhau network. Unfortunately they do not have a Js sdk. Therefore, for the sake of the hackathon and to have an always available programmable endpoint, we took the standalone client and wrapped it in express js to provide an accessible API endpoint. \n\nThe patient uploads his/her medical images and incentivised by the aggregator. The marketplace section of the app connects the researcher with the aggregarors's offering. The platform makes running AI jobs simple and affordable. \n\nThe researcher needs to wrap his/her algorithm / code in a docker container and supply the absolute command to the platform. The command is executed on the bacalhau network by reading the content from an input directory pointed to by the cid of the data set  and stores the results in the output dir. Bacalhau copies over the output data to ipfs and returns a cid for access by the researcher. The bacalhau network is currently public hence the invocable compute client is hosted on Google cloud. \n\nThe programmable endpoint is basically the glue that connects the pieces of the puzzle together forming a completely decentralized compute platform for medical research. \n\nFinally, the entire app is hosted on spheron.

The POMP NFT is minted with blank metadata which will then be customized by the owner based on their current skills and openness to mentor other community members. \nSecond, the member can customize the skills they have based on a preset list shared by the community admins with POMP. These skills will appear as unverified initially, until a member vouches the other person has them after a 1:1 session. The skills will be verified through the interactions new members have with each other. \n\nThird, Members looking for a mentor are set to go! \nBy using the Graph, we will index the metadata from the dynamic NFTs and enable users to filter through other members profiles based on the skills they are looking to be mentored on and on the willingness of others to be mentors. Potential mentors who meet the selected criteria will be displayed to the user along with the complete set of skills linked to that NFT.\n\nFourth, Connect! \nThe member can choose a mentor from the selection displayed and set up a 1:1 video/voice mentorship session with them. The interest of mentorship will be recorded. During the session, both members will be asked to record the session, this will allow them to come back and review if needed, but will also enable them to rate the mentorship they gave/received and the skills the person they interacted with has. \n\nFive: Rate! \n\nAfter completing the session, members will be asked to upload their recordings to Livepeer, which will mint them a Proof of Mentorship NFT, signaling they have completed the session they had signed up for. The more mentorships people give/receive, the more POMs they’ll receive to validate their skills and contributions to the community. These POMs will also enable them to rate the mentorship they had in a private way using Semaphore to avoid retaliation in case the feedback is negative. The POMPs minted after the mentorship will recognize these two members a part of a group an enable the rating of the interaction in a private form. \n\nSix: Grow\n\nMembers skills and rating will be updated in the NFT following 5 interactions, to ensure the privacy of the raters.

    "how_its_made": "First, the member will receive a code from the admins to be able to mint their dynamic POMP NFT. \n\n- Open Zeppelin: We use the Open Zeppelin libraries and standards to mint our dynamic NFTs.\n- Cartesi: We are using Cartesi to reduce the gas costs that would otherwise be required to register every single update to the dynamic NFTs users hold on the mainnet. Instead, all of these changes take place in the Cartesi Machine and are only updated in batch at a later time.\n- Worldcoin: By asking users to provide a proof of personhood when they sign up, we are taking the first step towards securing the platform against bot attacks along with the code requested from the community admins.\nProof of Mentorship enables community members to connect with others who can be instrumental in their professional development. Mentors can go on and create life long relations or relationships. \nMembers who have logged in through Worldcoin can be identified as more reliable and will never be challenged on the basis of being bots trying to game the system.\n- Web3Auth: We use Web3Auth to create a more inclusive onboarding platform for newcomers to web3 by enabling them to mint their POMP NFT directly through social login.\nOur goal is to improve a newcomers entryway into web3. For that reason we want people who are new to communities to be able to find mentors that will steer them through the process. We have built a frictionless UX to make sure that people who are most familiar with web2 apps can continue to enjoy the seamlessness of said interactions, making the use of a web3 product light. By using Web3Auth we can build an inclusive app to onboard community members who are new to web3, do not own a wallet and benefit the most from mentorship opportunities. This is specially relevant to regions like Latam where Whatsapp and Facebook have a very strong adoption.\n- WalletConnect: We use WalletConnect to create a frictionless log-in process into our platform regardless of your location with over 100 wallets. By enabling such a wide number of wallets to log-in to our platform, we ensure that the platform is useful to communities all over the globe and with users in multiple regions and at multiple stages of their web3 journey.\n- Metamask: We have incorporated Metamask to provide an additional sign in method for users.\n\nSecond, the member can customize the skills they have based on a preset list shared by the community admins with POMP. \n\n- IPFS: We are using IPFS to save the metadata of our dynamic NFTs that will later enable the query functionality required to match mentees with mentors. Each time a user updates their skills, a new URI will be created and updated to the IPFS file. We are using a JSON file in order to store large amounts of data, which we expect as continues updates to the dynamic NFTs take place.\n\nThird, Members looking for a mentor are set to go!\n\n- The Graph: We have created a new subgraph that queries the dynamic NFTs associated to our smart contracts. \nThe Subgraph is integrated to our front-end and looks like a simple filtering feature for users to easily identify the mentors who have the skills they are looking to receive mentorship in.\n\nFourth, Connect!\nThe member can choose a mentor from the selection displayed and set up a 1:1 video/voice mentorship session with them. \n\n- Livepeer: We use Livepeer for users to 1) replay the mentorship sessions they have had, and for our protocol to 1) validate that the mentorships took place, 2) trigger the ability for members to rate the mentorship, 3) verify that members are not gaming the system by auditing the video files.\n\nFive: Rate!\n\nAfter completing the session, members will be asked to upload their recordings to Livepeer, which will mint them a Proof of Mentorship NFT, signaling they have completed the session they had signed up for. \n\n- Semaphore: POMP uses Semaphore Proofs to signal anonymously with zero knowledge proofs, the rating members give each other after a mentorship took place. We use Semaphore since it allows for: 1) POMP to identify that the person belongs to the group who took part in the mentorship, 2) The person has only rated the other members in the group once. \n\nAfter completing a mentorship session members are asked to rate their experience and validate the skills their mentor/mentee displayed. To enable members to freely express themselves and rate their mentors negatively, if merited, all feedback provided by members  is recorded as signals that cannot be linked back to the member issuing it. We are using Semaphore to preserve a members anonymity when submitting feedback. \nThe Semaphore protocol is triggered with the minting of Proof of Mentorship NFTs.

    "how_its_made": "The SuperConnect Wallet project is built on top of SuperChain, leveraging a variety of technologies to create a robust and efficient application. Below are the key components and details of the architecture:\n\n## Technologies Used\n\n1. **Web3Auth**: This technology is utilized for creating a multi-party computation (MPC)-based wallet, which enhances security and user experience by allowing users to authenticate without exposing their private keys.\n\n2. **WorldCoin's Sign in With WorldID**: This feature is integrated using IDKit with Incognito Actions, enabling users to sign in securely and privately, ensuring their identity is protected.\n\n3. **Blockscout**: This serves as the block explorer, allowing users to view transactions and other blockchain data in a user-friendly interface.\n\n4. **Conduit**: Used to build the SuperConnect Layer 2 (L2) solution using the Optimistic Rollup (OP) Stack, Conduit provides an inbuilt bridge, facilitating seamless asset transfers between different chains.\n\n5. **React with Vite**: The front-end of the application is developed using React, enhanced by Vite for faster builds and hot module replacement, improving the development experience.\n\n6. **Express Server**: An Express server is employed to handle requests, manage sessions, and verify proofs received from IDKit, ensuring that all transactions and interactions are processed efficiently.\n\n## Integration and Architecture\n\nThe architecture of SuperConnect Wallet is designed to ensure smooth interaction between the various components. The Express server acts as the backbone, managing API requests and responses, while the React front-end communicates with the server to display user data and facilitate transactions.\n\n- **User Authentication**: When a user signs in using WorldID, the Express server verifies the identity and generates the necessary session tokens. This process is streamlined through the integration of Web3Auth, which manages wallet functionalities.\n\n- **Transaction Processing**: The Express server also handles transaction requests. It communicates with the blockchain through Conduit, allowing the application to send and receive assets efficiently.\n\n- **Data Visualization**: Blockscout is integrated to provide users with real-time insights into their transactions and the overall state of the blockchain, enhancing transparency and user trust.\n\n## Notable Hacks\n\nOne notable hack employed in the project involves directly making transactions with the provider.

    "description": "I am planning to develop an AI-powered article generator that will be able to create high-quality content by utilizing data stored in both NFT.Storage and Supabase, two advanced and secure platforms for decentralized and scalable data storage.\n\nThe primary goal of this project is to create a sophisticated tool that can generate rich, context-aware, and original articles by leveraging cutting-edge natural language processing and machine learning techniques. The AI-driven generator would be capable of processing and analyzing a vast corpus of articles stored on NFT.Storage and Supabase, both of which provide robust solutions for data management and security.\n\nNFT.Storage, a decentralized storage platform designed for NFTs, allows us to take advantage of the IPFS and Filecoin networks for secure, reliable, and comprehensive content storage. Supabase, on the other hand, offers a scalable, open-source solution for database and backend management, making it a perfect choice for maintaining structured data and metadata related to the articles stored in NFT.Storage.\n\nTo develop this state-of-the-art AI article generator, I will focus on the following aspects:\n\n1. Design and implement an efficient AI model that can assimilate, process, and analyze the wide range of data available on NFT.Storage and Supabase to generate high-quality articles with a coherent structure, meaningful insights, and contextually appropriate language.\n2. Create a robust data pipeline that can fetch, preprocess, and manage the articles stored across both platforms, allowing the AI model to access a diverse and extensive dataset for its operation.\n3. Optimize the AI model's performance and accuracy by continuously evaluating its output against a predefined set of quality metrics, ensuring the generator remains abreast of the latest advancements in natural language processing and machine learning.\n4. Integrate the AI article generator with a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to request new articles and access the generated content with ease.\n5. Implement appropriate security measures and access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the gated content generated by the AI model.\n\nUltimately, my aspiration is to build an AI-driven article generator that seamlessly combines the capabilities of NFT.Storage and Supabase, offering users the ability to generate context-rich articles from a vast repository of sources, all while maintaining the integrity and security of the data.",
    "how_its_made": "The envisioned application aims to use NFT.Storage as the primary storage platform for articles, Supabase for efficient indexing and data management, and Ethereum smart contracts for gating access to generated content. This combination of advanced technologies will result in a powerful, secure, and user-friendly solution for creating, storing, and accessing AI-generated articles.\n\nUsing NFT.Storage as the core storage infrastructure leverages the stability and reliability of the IPFS and Filecoin networks for decentralized and persistent content storage. This approach ensures that the articles remain secure and accessible even when traditional cloud services might encounter issues.\n\nSupabase, a scalable and open-source backend solution, is employed for indexing and managing structured data and metadata related to the articles stored in NFT.Storage. By utilizing Supabase, the application can benefit from its powerful, real-time, and PostgreSQL-backed database, allowing for efficient organization, retrieval, and manipulation of the articles' information.\n\nEthereum smart contracts serve as the backbone for gating access to the AI-generated articles. With the use of blockchain technology, smart contracts introduce a level of security, transparency, and integrity that ensures only authorized users have access to the gated content.\n\nTo bring this concept to life, I will concentrate on the following key areas:\n\n1. Design an architecture that seamlessly integrates NFT.Storage, Supabase, and Ethereum smart contracts, enabling them to work in harmony for optimal performance and security.\n2. Develop an AI-powered article generator capable of creating high-quality, context-rich content by leveraging the wealth of data stored on both NFT.Storage and Supabase platforms.\n3. Implement a robust data API that can interact with the underlying platforms, fetching and processing content as needed, ensuring smooth communication between the frontend, backend, and storage systems.\n4. Design and deploy a set of Ethereum smart contracts responsible for regulating user access to the generated articles, managing permissions, tracking usage, and handling payments if a monetization model is desired.\n5. Develop a user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of requesting AI-generated articles, accessing the gated content, and managing user permissions through the Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nUltimately, my objective is to build a sophisticated, AI-driven article generator that effectively harnesses NFT.Storage, Supabase, and Ethereum smart contracts, providing users with a secure and efficient means to generate, store, and access high-quality content that meets their specific needs.",

    "description": "This governance application empowers users to participate in a decentralized DataDAO ecosystem powered by **DataCoin** on the Sepolia testnet. To get started, connect your MetaMask wallet (ensuring you are on Sepolia) and instantly view your DataCoin balance and the total supply. You can upload `.txt` files through the **Upload Data** section, where files are encrypted, stored on IPFS via Lighthouse, and rewarded with 10 DataCoins per successful upload after completing (or skipping, for testing) Reclaim verification. Beyond earning tokens, members can actively shape the DAO by participating in **Governance**, browsing live proposals, and casting votes weighted by their DataCoin holdings, with real-time tracking of results. Your impact is visible through continuous monitoring of your balance, voting influence as a percentage of total supply, transaction history, and DAO circulation metrics. The **DataCoin contract** (address: `0xa14159C1B383fBCa4A9C197aFC83E01DB4655B24` on Sepolia) incorporates role-based access control, vesting, and governance integration. Under the hood, **Lighthouse Web3** secures data integrity through encrypted, decentralized storage on IPFS, eliminating single points of failure. **Reclaim Protocol** ensures cryptographic, privacy-preserving verification via zero-knowledge proofs, supporting trust and scalability. Finally, **Hypergraph** powers advanced decentralized data management, enabling flexible schema definitions, complex queries, real-time insights, and interoperability with other dApps—all designed to ensure scalability, security, and transparency in the DataDAO ecosystem.\n",
    "how_its_made": "This project implements a decentralized governance and data marketplace system powered by **DataCoin** on the Sepolia testnet, structured around a modular React 19 frontend and Web3-enabled backend. The codebase is organized with React components, backend services for smart contract and Reclaim Protocol verification, static assets, and key files such as `FileUpload.tsx` for encrypted IPFS uploads with token rewards, `Governance.tsx` for DAO proposal voting, `schema.ts` for Hypergraph entity definitions, and context providers like `BalanceContext.tsx` and `MetaMaskContext.tsx` for real-time balance tracking and wallet connectivity. Users earn **10 DataCoins per verified file upload**, starting from an initial supply of 0, with token utility centered on governance where each token equals one vote, enabling democratic participation in DAO decisions. The platform relies on **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet** for blockchain operations and **IPFS via Lighthouse Web3** for decentralized, encrypted storage. Core features include secure data handling with client-side encryption, wallet-based authentication, drag-and-drop uploads, and Lighthouse-backed IPFS integration; privacy-preserving verification with **Reclaim Protocol** using zero-knowledge proofs, real-time validation, and tamper-proof integrity guarantees; transparent token economics with ERC-20 compliant minting, live balance updates, and verifiable on-chain logs; and governance with community-driven proposals, weighted voting, live results, and stake-based influence. Future-ready **Hypergraph integration** allows defining schemas and entity relationships (e.g., Address, Project, Event) with efficient decentralized queries and scalable DAO data management. The tech stack spans **React 19, TypeScript, Vite, and React Router** for frontend development; **Web3.js, Ethers.js, and MetaMask** for blockchain interaction; **Lighthouse Web3 SDK, IPFS, and Reclaim Protocol** for storage and verification; and backend services built with **Express.js** and a Reclaim verification server. To install and run locally, clone the repository , install dependencies (`npm install`), create a `.env` file with your private key (`VITE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here`), and start the development server using `npm run dev`.\n",

    "description": "VeriFile is a decentralized professional identity and credential verification platform designed to combat resume fraud and empower individuals with true ownership of their academic and professional records. In the current system, verifying a credential is a slow, manual process that relies on contacting institutions directly, while digital certificates are often just easily forged PDFs. This creates a significant trust gap in the hiring process.\nThis project combines a user-friendly, browser-based frontend with a robust Web3 backend to create a transparent and immutable ecosystem for credentials. The platform allows accredited institutions to issue fraud-proof, on-chain credentials directly to a user's digital wallet. Employers can then verify these records instantly with absolute certainty, drastically reducing hiring friction and eliminating fraud.\nThe core workflow is designed around three key user groups:\n1. Institutions (Universities, Certification Bodies): An institution uses its verified decentralized identity to issue credentials as Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) or Verifiable Credentials. The rich metadata and visual representation of the certificate are permanently stored on Filecoin.\n2. Students & Professionals (The User): The user receives and holds their credentials directly in their wallet. Using MetaMask, they have full sovereignty over their professional identity, controlling who can view their records without relying on any central intermediary. Their on-chain identity is managed through the Self.ID protocol, allowing for a rich, user-controlled profile.\n3. Employers & Recruiters: An employer can access a simple verification portal. By connecting with a candidate's public address or ENS name, they can instantly see an immutable and authentic record of their entire professional and academic history.\n",

Our bonding curve has a 100% reserve and negligible price inflation vs. circulating supply.  Its designed against speculation, manipulation, front-running, flash loan attacks, and regulatory risk.

On the server, we aggregate all the signals from all mobile phones connected to SkyFrames worldwide, allowing users to view and inspect them. Farcaster clients will display them in the Frames dapp. In the future, we can build even more functionality based on these primitive elements: display maps of congestions of the drones, what time of the day or which day of the week there is the biggest traffic, or even track delivery drones flying with your McDonald's burger…",

Each card displays a users decenralised identity and avatar along with qualifications they have achieved on the network. The original intent was to calculate the various metrics to create an XP score however this wasn't possible within the weekend. So instead it offers 3 dimensions with two potential options each. \"ETH Maxi\" vs \"Token Trader\" attribute, based on whether a user has ERC20 transactions or not. \"NFT Collector\" or \"My First NFT\" based on whether a user has any prior NFT transactions and finally \"ETH Miner\" or \"Blockless\" based on wether the user has mined any blocks ot not.",

I began with a starter prokect from the IPFS/Filecoin team (https://github.com/DeveloperAlly/filecoin_nft_starter/blob/main/src/App.js) and forked this as the basis of Ethereum: The Tribe. It utilises NFT.Storage to publish a layered custom SVG to IPFS and Filecoin. This fork has a custom designed card style and also pulls in more dynamic elements from the Etherscan API. It queries the Etherscan API to get a list of; Ethereum, ERC20, ERC721, and Mining transactions to establish whether user has completed transactions of each type. It then outputs different attributes onto the card image for each of these as discussed above. Additionally, it pulls the ENS avatar with the ENS overlay from the ENS Metadata service. The project was working with the raw avatars, however the version with overlays requires the ENS namehas to be generated and I ran out of time to complete that funcionality this weekend. Once the image and attributes have been generated and uploaded to IPFS, the resulting NFT is then Minted. There were some issues with Rinkeby over the weekend so the project was ported to Goerli for testing. Additionally to mint the screenshots, I temporarily modified the API calls to pull data from mainnet where I already had an ENS name and Avatar configured. There were some challenges with getting NFT.Storage to upload images with avatar images embedded within them. I narrowed this down to what I believe is a security block for base64 encoded PNG inclusions within SVG files. Apart from this, it completely automates the process of pinning in a sustaible fashion and is much easierto set up than managing your own node, plus with the API you aren't limited to manual uploads. One thing I have noticed is the final SVGs which work on their own and within the site, do not appear on OpenSea. I'm not sure if this is a parsing issue or something to do with their testnet edition. I requested an API key, but did not have the opportunity to go deeper here. Overall, I still think the project is quirky and could find some appeal however the codebase still needs significant development to reach production levels of code. If this were to be released and promoted it may also make sense to pull more data diectly from the chain instead of through a mixture of APIs.",

    "description": "The problem Trankers solves:\nMost of the games existing in the current Web3 space are focused on the Play To Earn (P2E) model. The fundamental reason for utilizing the P2E model by these games is to allow the players to accumulate as many prizes as possible, even though they are not very enjoyable to play. Players treat the game as a task in order to earn rewards and withdraw them, thus not contributing to the growth of the community. This leads to lower loyalty towards the games, resulting in the games’ having a weaker token economy. This has a major impact on the future survival of these games.\n\nOur Solution: \nRather than focusing on a “Play-to-earn” centric game, our focus is on building the game on top of the “Play-and-earn” model.\n\nOur belief is that a “Play-and-earn” game will help our community and the project create a long-term success roadmap for each other rather than just hype-based gameplay that falls short in creating a sustainable, strong gamer community in the long run.\n\nTrankers is a multi-chain gaming platform, which means that players can select the chain that they have funds in and play and earn on top of that chain.\nCurrently five Networks are supported on the platform, but we plan to add support for more blockchain networks.",
    "how_its_made": "To develop this platform, we used:\n\nNext.JS: \nWe used the most popular React Framework for building our frontend.\n\nMulti-Chain/ Multiple Blockchain Networks:\nAs of now our game supports five networks which include:\n1. Polygon\n2. Optimism\n3. SKALE Network\n4. Cronos\n5. Aurora\nOn all of these networks we have deployed two smart contracts, the first one being \"The Inventory\"(all in game items) and the second one being the ERC20 TRT Token.\n\nCovalent API:\nFor loading the metadata of the in game items, insteading of needing to call the data from the chain, we used the NFT Rest api. This allowed us to fetch all items faster as compared to making a direct native call.\n\nQuickNode Token API:\nWe used this API for continuously updating the user's TRT balance. Sometimes making frequent calls directly to the blockchain causes issues. But using this API we were able to eliminate that issue as well.\n\n`IPFS: \nAll the in-game items like various tanks and upgrades are stored on chain using an ERC-1155 Contract. Now in order for us to be able to utilize the \"metadata\" that the standard provides, we used IPFS to host and sync the metadata (image url, price, various attributes and variation, title, description) on-chain.\n\n\n\nValist:\nWe used Valist for publishing our project on their platform. It makes it easier to distribute our product.",

    "description": "GUIDE2FILM3 aka Guide to Blockchain Cinema by filmfund.eth is an AI-powered web3 platform designed to connect audiences, filmmakers, and blockchain technology through culture, storytelling, and data transparency. The project aims to make the emerging world of film3 — blockchain-integrated cinema — accessible, understandable, and participatory.\n\nAt its core, the platform acts as an interactive guide and discovery engine for films, documentaries, and creative projects that explore crypto, blockchain, or decentralized themes. Users can log in, browse curated content, and receive intelligent recommendations powered by AI agent, our custom agent built with the Artificial Superintelligence Alliance (Fetch.ai uAgents). The agent converses naturally, suggesting what to watch based on interests or web3 experience level, and provides background about each film’s story, director, genre, and blockchain relevance.\n\nBeyond film discovery, the app features a crowdfunding and support section powered by PayPal USD (PYUSD) and crypto escrow smart contracts. Here, users can directly support filmmakers building blockchain-themed projects. Supporters can earn personalized perks, appear in film credits, or gain early access to screenings — all with stable, borderless transactions.\n\nFor transparency, Blockscout SDK integration allows every on-chain transaction, funding milestone, and project metric to be viewed in real time. A Film Data Dashboard compares film-token performance (sales speed, fundraising success, community engagement), bridging cinematic storytelling with real on-chain analytics.\n\nThe platform serves two main audiences:\n\nViewers and web3 Enthusiasts — exploring and supporting blockchain cinema through AI-driven discovery and transparent data.\n\nFilmmakers and Creators — receiving guidance from a specialized AI agent that introduces them to film3 opportunities: decentralized festivals, NFT-based VOD platforms, and funding models across the web3 ecosystem.\n\nTechnically, the project combines modern AI and blockchain infrastructure:\n\nArtificial Superintelligence Alliance – uAgents for conversational agents and intelligent assistants.\n\nBlockscout SDK – for on-chain data visualization and transparency.\n\nPayPal USD – for accessible, stable payments supporting memberships and crowdfunding.\n\nFrontend Stack – Next.js (React), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Bum for smooth, modern UX.\n\nBackend Stack – Python and Solidity for smart contracts, data handling, and AI integration.\n\nThe result is an educational, entertaining, and functional gateway into blockchain culture — a place where cinema meets transparency, where AI meets storytelling, and where filmmakers and audiences can learn, fund, and connect on-chain.\n\nUltimately, GUIDE2FILM3 aka Guide to Blockchain Cinema by filmfund.eth represents the next step in redefining crypto narratives through art and technology, helping web3 evolve not just as a financial ecosystem but as a cultural movement. ",
    "how_its_made": "GUIDE2FILM3 aka Guide to Blockchain Cinema by filmfund.eth was built as a modular, web3-native application combining AI agents, blockchain analytics, and payment infrastructure into a unified cultural platform. Our goal during ETH GLOBAL Online was to make the architecture both technically sound and emotionally engaging — something that connects data, creativity, and community in one interface.\n\nArchitecture Overview\n\nThe system consists of three main layers:\n\nFrontend (User Layer) — Built with Next.js (React), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, hosted in a Bum runtime for fast edge deployment. This layer delivers two main user journeys:\n\nFilm Enthusiasts: movie discovery, AI recommendations, reviews, and crowdfunding.\n\nFilmmakers: onboarding to web3 and access to film3 resources.\n\nIntegrated with Fetch.ai’s uAgents (Artificial Superintelligence Alliance) to deploy “AI agent” an on-chain conversational agent.\n\nThe agent can context-switch between two modes: Viewer Mode (suggesting blockchain films) and Filmmaker Mode (recommending Web3 tools, platforms, and festivals).\n\nBlockchain Layer (Transparency & Payments) —\n\nBlockscout SDK provides real-time indexing and visualization of on-chain data: users can explore how film tokens performed, transaction histories, and campaign funding status.\n\nSolidity smart contracts manage escrowed contributions and membership payments.\n\nPayPal USD (PYUSD) integration allows stablecoin payments for memberships and filmmaker support — bridging web2 familiarity with web3 transparency.\n\nPartner Technology Benefits\n\nArtificial Superintelligence Alliance: enabled us to rapidly prototype intelligent, conversational agents without building custom inference infrastructure.\n\nBlockscout: simplified on-chain data visibility and let us display verified film token metrics directly inside the app.\n\nPayPal USD: offered a trusted stable payment gateway, lowering the barrier for non-crypto users supporting Film3 projects.\n\nNotable / Hacky Things\n\nWe created a dual-persona AI (one for viewers, one for filmmakers) using a shared vector database but context-specific prompts — effectively “two minds sharing one brain.”\n\nWe used Python’s FastAPI to act as a bridge service between AI Agents, Blockscout APIs, and the front-end, synchronizing chat responses with on-chain data in real time.\n\nImplemented a mock escrow system using PYUSD testnet to simulate transparent film-funding rounds.\n\nPrototyped a mini dashboard that aggregates film token analytics from multiple networks, demonstrating how cultural projects can have transparent fundraising histories.\n\nIn short: we combined cutting-edge AI infrastructure with transparent blockchain data and accessible payments to build the first cultural guide that lets people watch, fund, and understand blockchain cinema — all in one decentralized experience.
